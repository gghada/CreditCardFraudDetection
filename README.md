# Credit Card Fraud Detection

A Python project that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using PyTorch, NumPy, and Pandas.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
- Uses the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).  
- Preprocesses the data (scaling features, handling class imbalance).  
- Trains a neural network to classify transactions as **Fraud (1)** or **Not Fraud (0)**.  
- Supports both **training** and **inference** for new transactions.  
- Evaluation metrics include **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**.
